    <h2><b>Java Introduction </b></h2>
    
<aside> Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language developed by Sun MicroSystem in the year 1991.At the beginning it is called as Oak, then  it is renamed as Java. Java was designed to be simple, object - oriented, robust, safe, small, secure and portable across platforms and operating systems both at the source and at the binary level.It is mainly used to develop web programming. </aside><br>
<h2><b>Java is the combination of C and C++ :</b></h2><br>
<td>Java is platform independent at both the source and the binary level.  So, every  operating system can use Java.  But they must load JVM (Java Virtual Machine.). It runs in all plat-forms like  windows, dos, unix,linux and macintosh.  It is highly case sensitive.

	In Java ,when a program is complied, an object file with byte code is created.  Byte codes are the basic instructions that can be executed only by the java virutal machine.  (Class file created).  Then JVM turns the byte codes into a version that can be executed by the actual machine.Compiler is in JVM,it is used to convert source code into Byte code.(javac).

	Interpreter is plat-form independent,it is used to execute the byte code. (java).

Another important component that is used with the JVM is the Java Application programming Interface(API). The API is the collection of complied code that can be included in the java program we write. The JVM and API's together are referred to as the java platform.There are two types of Java Programming.

<h2><b>1.Application:
	</b></h2>
	<td>An Application is Java program that can run on computers with the JVM.  Java application are more general program written in the Java language.  It don't require a  browser to run. They are like computer programs written using any other high level languages.</td>

	<h2><b>2. Applets:</b></h2>
	
	<td>A Java applet is a program that typically needs a web browser for 
execution. <br>The browser has an inbuilt JVM that helps in executing these applets.</td>
<h2><b>How to create a java file:</b></h2>
<td>To create a java program a text editor is used.  A popular windows based text editor is NotePad.( we also use wordpad, Dos-edit command)</td><br>
<b>Steps:</b><br>
<td>1. start ---> programs  ----> notepad  ---->  type the java prg and save. The exetension of the file must be .java  (save in all files)

		filename.java

<br>2. Come back  to Dos prompt and compile your java file using Java Complier.
      (javac).  Before that you must change your directory where your files are saved.
      ( if you mapped in f: then change in dosprompt as a f:)

		  javac filename.java

<br>3. If there is no error in your prg then the dos prompt is returned, then run the program using java Interpreter(java).</td>

<h2><b>java classname:</b></h2>
	
<td>
	1.set the parth 
(save in your map drive folder)
(D:\java\first.java)<br>
2.start  --->  programs  ---> Ms-dos prompt  ---> change your drive
(default drive is c:\ so change your drive<br>
        
	      C:\>D: press  enter<br>
        	      D:\>cd java  press enter<br>
	      D:\java>set classpath="%classpath%";.<br>
		   	or
	     D:\java>set classpath="%d:\ecom\jdk1.3\bin%";<br>
				or
		      set path="%path%";d:\ecom\jdk1.3\bin; <br>  

	       D:\java>javac first.java   (File name)<br>
	       D:\java>java first  (Class name)<br>

                           after that error form then give (set classpath="%classpath%";) </td>
